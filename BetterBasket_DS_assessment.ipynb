    "To extract key information from product images, we could use the following pipeline of procedures: \n",
    "\n",
    "1 Image Preprocessing:\n",
    "- Enhance image quality and adjust brightness/contrast if necesary.\n",
    "- Check for alternative angles for the product, in order to process all images of the same product as a group.\n",
    "    \n",
    "2 Object Detection: \n",
    "- Use pre-trained object detection models (such as YOLO) to identify and locate objects with the image\n",
    "- Identify the main (target) object and ignore text boxes, banners and additional marketing elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "3 Image Segmentation:\n",
    "- Employ deep learning segmentation and/or edge detection techniques to divide the image into meaningful regions.\n",
    "- Identify the product's boundaries, in order to detect the packaging type (bottle, box, etc) to record it.\n",
    "\n",
    "4 Feature Extraction:\n",
    "- Use pattern matching or train a classificiation model to identify specific markers (e.g. US GROWN) on the packaging.\n",
    "- Use another model to identify markers that indicate applicable discounts.\n",
    "\n",
    "5 Text Extraction:\n",
    "- Use optical character recognition (OCR) to extract text information from the product image, such as product names, descriptions and other labels.\n",
    "- Additionally detect information such as volume, weight and nutritional information.\n",
    "\n",
    "6 Classification:\n",
    "- Train a classification model to categorize products (e.g. beverage, rice, pasta, etc).\n",
    "  \n",
    "7 Quality Control:\n",
    "- Implement checks to ensure the accuracy of the information extracted.\n",
    "- Address false positives/negatives and refine the model if necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "8 Integration with database: \n",
    "- Store the extracted information in a structured format and integrate it into a database.\n",
    "  \n",
    "9 Maintenance:\n",
    "- Update and retrain the models with new data to adapt to changes in the product images.tem category\n"
